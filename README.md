# Visual Attention in CNNs – ResNet with Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE)

---

## Business Problem

In computer vision applications like **medical imaging**, **autonomous driving**, and **defect detection**, models must **focus on the most informative regions** of an image. Standard CNNs treat all regions equally, potentially missing key features. 

This project solves that by incorporating **Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) attention mechanisms** into ResNet, improving focus on salient features and boosting classification performance.

---

## Project Overview

This project compares a **standard ResNet18** with a version enhanced by the **SE Block**, evaluating their performance on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Includes:
- Training pipeline for ResNet with/without attention
- Accuracy evaluation and comparison
- Grad-CAM overlays for model explainability
- Streamlit app to classify custom images
- GIF demo of predictions
- Jupyter Notebook to run all steps

## Grad-CAM Visualization (NEW!)

Integrated Grad-CAM to visually explain why the model made a particular prediction.

Available in Streamlit app  
Toggle to activate Grad-CAM overlay

## Accuracy Comparison

| Model            | Accuracy (%) |
|------------------|--------------|
| ResNet18         | ~78%         |
| ResNet + SE Block| ~82%         |

---

## How to Run

### 1. Install Requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Train Models
```bash
python src/train.py
```

### 3. Evaluate Accuracy
```bash
python src/evaluate.py
```

### 4. Launch Streamlit App
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app/app.py
```

Upload an image, select model type, and get predictions + Grad-CAM.
